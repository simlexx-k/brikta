### Key Features:

- Auto-Connector Setup: Plug-and-play with 50+ data sources.

- ML-Driven Schema Inference & Validation: Automated detection and anomaly checks.

- Unified Real-Time & Batch Processing: Stream and batch data workflows combined.

- Data Enrichment: Integrate APIs and NLP models to add intelligence to raw data.

- Compliance-First: Built-in GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA readiness.

### 🏗️ Architecture

Components:

- Data Source Connectors: APIs, databases, cloud storage.

- Ingestion Engine: Batch and stream processing.

- ML Microservices: Schema inference, anomaly detection.

- Storage Layer: Data lakes and warehouses.

- User Interface: Dashboard & API gateway.

### 🚀 Execution Plan

#### Phase 1: MVP (0–6 Months)

- Core engine with CSV, REST APIs, S3 connectors.
